## What is HSL
This is an industrial IoT based, computer communications architecture implementation, integrated with most of the basic functional implementation of industrial software development, 
such as Mitsubishi PLC Communications, Siemens PLC Communications, OMRON PLC Communications, Modbus Communications,
All of these communications have been implemented in multiple languages, and of course, the feature integration of the main. NET Library is even more powerful, 
in addition to the implementation of cross-program, cross-language, cross-platform communication, so that you are no longer obsessed with the use of Windows or Linux system, 
the realization of log function, flow number generation function, mail sending function, Fourier transform function, and so on, 
will integrate more common features of industrial environment in the future.

In order not to let the industry 4.0 stay on the slogan, the high-rise flat up, and the cornerstone is HSL.

## What can HSL do
HSL can connect the equipment of the industrial production site to the free transmission of data at the bottom, whether active or passive, 
whatever your acquisition system (usually the acquisition system is a Windows computer, or an embedded system, or a Linux-based box),
can achieve the random transmission of data, convenient and fast to achieve a strong, real-time, high-response robust system, whether you are building a C/S system, 
or B/S system, or C-B-S-A (Integrated desktop client, browser, Android) hybrid system, is a fast and low-cost implementation,

As long as you have the primary data of the industrial field, that is, can build a powerful real-time monitoring function of the software,
production reports and automated scheduling software, a variety of process parameters history tracking software, data based on the experience of machine learning software, 
as well as full-featured MES system and so on. 

**By the way**, the traditional industrial model is the procurement of off-the-shelf industrial software, 
including the host computer software and MES system, while ignoring their own system.
For some industry-standard functional software, such as ERP systems, financial software, these can be purchased directly,
However, for the host computer and MES system, the actual needs of each enterprise are very different, it is difficult to have a common scene, 
and the current situation is to spend a lot of money to do small things, so here, give a future-oriented model to achieve: for the production enterprise, 
Based on HSL to develop enterprise-class MES system implementation, as the core Warehouse center of data, and business logic processing Center, 
for equipment suppliers, based on HSL to develop the host computer software system, fast and convenient distribution of data to the customer's MES system, work together.
